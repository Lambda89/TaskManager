		Comment:
			These should be set up once at the beginning of the use on a server
			or development structure. The idea is too keep the basic structure
			here to avoid later problems with different local structures.
			In other words, we'll use this as a base and use these so we can
			compensate for various differences in the servers including what
			kind of database and driver it uses if necessary.

			Basic assumption of PHP5.3+ is being used.

			SHOULD BE UNDER GIT IGNORE!!!
