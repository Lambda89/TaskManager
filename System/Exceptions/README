This directory contains all the various Exceptions this app will use.

Exception and ErrorException are defined in the error_handler.php which is used by the sys.class.php in the
autoloading.
All exceptions use this as a base for their basic behavior. Remember that an exception can be quite complex
if needed.
The codes will detail from which part of the system they were first thrown.

Codes :

	1000 - low level system

	2000 - Entity exceptions

	3000 - CompoundClass Exceptions

	4000 - View Exceptions

	5000 - Utilities Exception
