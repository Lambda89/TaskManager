This directory contains all the various Exceptions this app will use.

Exception and ErrorException are defined in the error_handler.php which is used by the sys.class.php in the
autoloading.
All exceptions use this as a base for their basic behavior. Remember that an exception can be quite complex
if needed.
The codes will detail from which part of the system they were first thrown.

Codes :

	1*** - low level system
	1000 - sys.class.php exceptions, specific to this particular file

	2*** - Entity exceptions

	3*** - CompoundClass Exceptions

	4*** - View Exceptions

	5*** - Utilities Exception

( *** means any number in this case, the code is always between 1000 and 9999 )
