This directory contains all the various Exceptions this app will use.

Exception and ErrorException are defined in the error_handler.php which is used by the sys.class.php in the
autoloading.
All exceptions use this as a base for their basic behavior. Remember that an exception can be quite complex
if needed.
The codes will detail from which part of the system they were first thrown.

Codes :

	1*** - low level system
	1000 - sys.class.php exceptions, specific to this particular file
	
	1100 - Failed in some way with the Database
	1101 - Wrong server 
	1102 - Wrong port
	1103 - Wrong username
	1104 - Wrong password
	1110 - Failed SQL request in some way.
